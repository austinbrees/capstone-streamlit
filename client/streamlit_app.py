    Our new and improved dashboard app provides you with valuable insights into your retail data through a streamlined interface. The app has three main pages: Articles, Customers, and Transactions. Each page contains visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) that help you better understand your business.

    1. **Articles Page:** This page displays KPIs and visualizations related to the best-selling products and departments, as well as the percentage of Ladieswear and Menswear. You can filter articles by department and color using the sidebar.

    2. **Customers Page:** On this page, you'll find KPIs such as customer count, average age, active customer count, and total countries. Additionally, you can view a choropleth map of customers by country and a table of customer data.

    3. **Transactions Page:** This page presents KPIs for total revenue, total transactions, and average transaction value. You can also view visualizations of product type distribution, transactions by sales channel, and total sales by day, along with transaction data in table format.
